Downloading your eBook onto an eReader device:

and then transfer it from your computer to your kindle.
-- To upload the eBook onto your phone or other device you will need to open the file on your computer 
and then download it onto your device

Reading your eBook with your PC or Mac:
If you want to download the eBook as an eReader onto your personal computer you will need to download the following 
software onto your computer.
Amazon makes a program called 'Kindle Previewer' that will open and read the .mobi version.
To obtain this software go here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000426311&tag=googhydr-20&hvadid=7893047648&ref=pd_sl_3ies3d4yuc_b
and then follow the directions. 
Adobe makes a program called 'Digital Editions' that will open and read the .epub version.  
To obtain this software go here: http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/
 and then follow the directions.  
You will be required to set up an adobe account.
Adobe also makes the software that opens .pdf files.  It is free and can be downloaded by going here:  http://get.adobe.com/reader/
This can be done without creating an account but again pdf's are not searchable.

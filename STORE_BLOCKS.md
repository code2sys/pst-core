Store Blocks
============

There was a problem for doing the Just4Fun Honda JavaScript pieces, so I have changed it so that we can put these things in via a file. We should eventually standardize these things and make it easier for them to jam things in.

The idea is that you create files in the base store directory starting with the prefix "store_block_", and then you can shove content into specific spots:

* top_header
* top_body
* bottom_header
* bottom_body

These will be checked in all seven master frames plus the motorcycle benz_views/header and benz_views/header.
